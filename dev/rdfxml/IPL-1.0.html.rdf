&#xD;
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM&#xD;
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION&#xD;
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
1. DEFINITIONS&#xD;
"Contribution" means:&#xD;
&#xD;
a.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the Original Program, and&#xD;
&#xD;
b.  in the case of each Contributor,&#xD;
	i.  changes to the Program, and&#xD;
	ii.  additions to the Program;&#xD;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and&#xD;
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution&#xD;
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by&#xD;
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's&#xD;
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:&#xD;
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with&#xD;
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not&#xD;
derivative works of the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a&#xD;
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its&#xD;
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Original Program" means the original version of the software&#xD;
accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source&#xD;
code, object code and documentation, if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xD;
Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xD;
a.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xD;
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright&#xD;
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,&#xD;
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such&#xD;
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and&#xD;
object code form.&#xD;
&#xD;
b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xD;
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent&#xD;
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,&#xD;
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,&#xD;
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license&#xD;
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program&#xD;
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such&#xD;
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by&#xD;
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xD;
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per&#xD;
se is licensed hereunder.&#xD;
&#xD;
c.  Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the&#xD;
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are&#xD;
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the&#xD;
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.&#xD;
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims&#xD;
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual&#xD;
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the&#xD;
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes&#xD;
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights&#xD;
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is&#xD;
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is&#xD;
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before&#xD;
distributing the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
d.  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xD;
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the&#xD;
copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. REQUIREMENTS&#xD;
A Contributor may choose to distribute&#xD;
the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,&#xD;
provided that:&#xD;
&#xD;
a.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xD;
b.  its license agreement:&#xD;
	i.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties&#xD;
	and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or&#xD;
	conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or&#xD;
	conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xD;
	ii.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability&#xD;
	for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and&#xD;
	consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xD;
	iii.  states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are&#xD;
	offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xD;
	iv.  states that source code for the Program is available from such&#xD;
	Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable&#xD;
	manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xD;
a.  it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xD;
b.  a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the&#xD;
Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
	Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator&#xD;
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xD;
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xD;
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain&#xD;
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the&#xD;
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial&#xD;
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a&#xD;
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not&#xD;
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a&#xD;
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,&#xD;
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend&#xD;
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")&#xD;
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising&#xD;
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third&#xD;
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the&#xD;
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with&#xD;
its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.&#xD;
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses&#xD;
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.&#xD;
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly&#xD;
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)&#xD;
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the&#xD;
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement&#xD;
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any&#xD;
such claim at its own expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial&#xD;
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial&#xD;
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance&#xD;
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance&#xD;
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's&#xD;
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor&#xD;
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to&#xD;
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any&#xD;
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial&#xD;
Contributor must pay those damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
5. NO WARRANTY&#xD;
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS&#xD;
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY&#xD;
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY&#xD;
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY&#xD;
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely&#xD;
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and&#xD;
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its&#xD;
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to&#xD;
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable&#xD;
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and&#xD;
unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xD;
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xD;
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xD;
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xD;
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON&#xD;
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR&#xD;
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF&#xD;
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS&#xD;
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xD;
&#xD;
7. GENERAL&#xD;
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under&#xD;
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of&#xD;
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further&#xD;
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the&#xD;
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xD;
&#xD;
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with&#xD;
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim&#xD;
or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by&#xD;
that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall&#xD;
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if&#xD;
Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including&#xD;
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program&#xD;
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or&#xD;
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's&#xD;
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such&#xD;
litigation is filed.&#xD;
&#xD;
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it&#xD;
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this&#xD;
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of&#xD;
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's&#xD;
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use&#xD;
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.&#xD;
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any&#xD;
licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue&#xD;
and survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement&#xD;
from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a&#xD;
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)&#xD;
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement&#xD;
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xD;
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xD;
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one&#xD;
other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as&#xD;
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives&#xD;
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor&#xD;
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or&#xD;
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under&#xD;
this Agreement are reserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and&#xD;
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No&#xD;
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this&#xD;
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each&#xD;
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</spdx:standardLicenseTemplate>

THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM&#xD;
PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION&#xD;
OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
1. DEFINITIONS&#xD;
"Contribution" means:&#xD;
&#xD;
a.  in the case of International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), the Original Program, and&#xD;
&#xD;
b.  in the case of each Contributor,&#xD;
	i.  changes to the Program, and&#xD;
	ii.  additions to the Program;&#xD;
where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and&#xD;
are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution&#xD;
'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by&#xD;
such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's&#xD;
behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:&#xD;
(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with&#xD;
the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not&#xD;
derivative works of the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Contributor" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a&#xD;
Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its&#xD;
Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Original Program" means the original version of the software&#xD;
accompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source&#xD;
code, object code and documentation, if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this&#xD;
Agreement, including all Contributors.&#xD;
&#xD;
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS&#xD;
a.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xD;
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright&#xD;
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,&#xD;
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such&#xD;
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and&#xD;
object code form.&#xD;
&#xD;
b.  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby&#xD;
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent&#xD;
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,&#xD;
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,&#xD;
if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license&#xD;
shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program&#xD;
if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such&#xD;
addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by&#xD;
the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any&#xD;
other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per&#xD;
se is licensed hereunder.&#xD;
&#xD;
c.  Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the&#xD;
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are&#xD;
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the&#xD;
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.&#xD;
Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims&#xD;
brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual&#xD;
property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the&#xD;
rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes&#xD;
sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights&#xD;
needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is&#xD;
required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is&#xD;
Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before&#xD;
distributing the Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
d.  Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has&#xD;
sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the&#xD;
copyright license set forth in this Agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
3. REQUIREMENTS&#xD;
A Contributor may choose to distribute&#xD;
the Program in object code form under its own license agreement,&#xD;
provided that:&#xD;
&#xD;
a.  it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and&#xD;
b.  its license agreement:&#xD;
	i.  effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties&#xD;
	and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or&#xD;
	conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or&#xD;
	conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;&#xD;
	ii.  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability&#xD;
	for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and&#xD;
	consequential damages, such as lost profits;&#xD;
	iii.  states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are&#xD;
	offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and&#xD;
	iv.  states that source code for the Program is available from such&#xD;
	Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable&#xD;
	manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
When the Program is made available in source code form:&#xD;
a.  it must be made available under this Agreement; and&#xD;
b.  a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the&#xD;
Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
Each Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location in the Program:&#xD;
&#xD;
	Copyright (C) 1996, 1999 International Business Machines Corporation and others. All Rights Reserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator&#xD;
of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows&#xD;
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION&#xD;
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain&#xD;
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the&#xD;
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial&#xD;
use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a&#xD;
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not&#xD;
create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a&#xD;
Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,&#xD;
such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend&#xD;
and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")&#xD;
against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising&#xD;
from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third&#xD;
party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the&#xD;
acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with&#xD;
its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.&#xD;
The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses&#xD;
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.&#xD;
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly&#xD;
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)&#xD;
allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the&#xD;
Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement&#xD;
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any&#xD;
such claim at its own expense.&#xD;
&#xD;
For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial&#xD;
product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial&#xD;
Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance&#xD;
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance&#xD;
claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's&#xD;
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor&#xD;
would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to&#xD;
those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any&#xD;
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial&#xD;
Contributor must pay those damages.&#xD;
&#xD;
5. NO WARRANTY&#xD;
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS&#xD;
PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY&#xD;
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY&#xD;
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY&#xD;
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely&#xD;
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and&#xD;
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its&#xD;
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to&#xD;
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable&#xD;
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and&#xD;
unavailability or interruption of operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY&#xD;
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT&#xD;
NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,&#xD;
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xD;
(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON&#xD;
ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR&#xD;
TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF&#xD;
THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS&#xD;
GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xD;
&#xD;
7. GENERAL&#xD;
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under&#xD;
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of&#xD;
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further&#xD;
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the&#xD;
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.&#xD;
&#xD;
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with&#xD;
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim&#xD;
or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by&#xD;
that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall&#xD;
terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if&#xD;
Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including&#xD;
a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program&#xD;
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or&#xD;
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's&#xD;
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such&#xD;
litigation is filed.&#xD;
&#xD;
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it&#xD;
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this&#xD;
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of&#xD;
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's&#xD;
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use&#xD;
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.&#xD;
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any&#xD;
licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue&#xD;
and survive.&#xD;
&#xD;
IBM may publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement&#xD;
from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a&#xD;
distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions)&#xD;
may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement&#xD;
under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the&#xD;
Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the&#xD;
Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. No one&#xD;
other than IBM has the right to modify this Agreement. Except as&#xD;
expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives&#xD;
no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor&#xD;
under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or&#xD;
otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under&#xD;
this Agreement are reserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and&#xD;
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No&#xD;
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this&#xD;
Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each&#xD;
party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</spdx:licenseText>
