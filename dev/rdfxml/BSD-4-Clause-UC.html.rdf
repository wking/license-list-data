    <rdfs:comment>This is the same license as the BSD-4-Clause, but with a copyright notice for the Regents of the University of California.  Captures the retroactive deletion of the third (advertising) clause of the Original BSD license for BSD-licensed code developed by UC Berkeley and its contributors (see ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change)</rdfs:comment>
