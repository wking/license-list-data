Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided upon on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability as regards the Licensee\u0027s use of the Software\u0027s name.

The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several occasions, to invoke one or several of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.\n      11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreement, whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.\n      11.4. In the event that one or several of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to be in compliance with said act or legislative text. All the other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, the fact that a provision of the Agreement may be null and void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole to be null and void.\n      11.5. LANGUAGE\n      The Agreement is drafted in both French and English. In the event of a conflict as regards construction, the French version shall be deemed authentic.\n   Article 12 - NEW VERSIONS OF THE AGREEMENT\n      12.1. Any or all person is authorized to duplicate and distribute copies of this Agreement.\n      12.2. So as to ensure coherence, the wording of this Agreement is protected and may only be modified by the authors of the License, that reserve the right to periodically publish updates or new versions of the Agreement, each with a separate number. These subsequent versions may address new issues encountered by Free Software.\n      12.3. Any or all Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement, or a subsequent version, subject to the provisions of article 5.3.4.\n   Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\n      13.1.
